# CompressionTool
In this step your goal is to build your tool to accept a filename as input. It should return an error if the file is not valid, otherwise your program should open it, read the text and determine the frequency of each character occurring within the text.

As a debugging aid you might like to optionally log out the table. Here’s some test values to check. There are 333 occurrences of ‘X’ and 223000 of ‘t’.

An alternate to logging the frequency table is to write some unit tests that take in some prepared data and then check that the counting code returns the correct values. Check your chosen programming language’s documentation for it’s unit testing library and if you’ve never tried it before consider giving test driven development a go.
